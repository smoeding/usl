\begin{abstract}\noindent
The Universal Scalability Law is used to quantify the scalability of hardware
or software systems. It uses sparse measurements from an existing system to
predict the throughput for different loads and can be used to learn more about
the scalability limitations of the system. This document introduces the `\usl'
package for \R{} and shows how easily it can be used to perform the relevant
calculations.

\section{Introduction}

Every system architect faces the challenge to deliver an application system
that meets the requirements. A critical point during the design is the
scalability of the system.

Informally scalability can be defined as the ability to support a growing
amount of work. A system is said to scale if it handles the changing demand or
hardware environment in a reasonable efficient and practical way.

Scalability can have two facets with respect to a computer system. On the one
hand, there is software scalability where the focus is about how the system
behaves when the demand increases, i.e., when more users are using it or more
requests need to be handled. On the other hand, there is hardware scalability
where the behavior of an application system running on larger hardware
configurations is investigated.

The Universal Scalability Law (USL) has been developed by Dr.~Neil~J.~Gunther
to allow the quantification of scalability for the purpose of capacity
planning. It provides an analytic model for the scalability of a computer
system.

A comprehensive introduction to the Universal Scalability Law
including the mathematical grounding has been published in \cite{Gun07}.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Background}

Dr.~Gunther shows in \cite{Gun07} how the scalability of every computer
system can be described by a common rational function. This function is
\emph{universal} in the sense that it does not assume any specific type
of software, hardware or system architecture.

\autoref{eqn:usl} has the Universal Scalability Law where $C(N) = X(N) / X(1)$
is the relative capacity given by the ratio of the measured throughput $X(N)$
for load $N$ to the throughput $X(1)$ for load $1$.

\begin{equation}\label{eqn:usl}
C(N) = \frac{N}{1 + \sigma (N - 1) + \kappa N (N - 1)}
\end{equation}

The denominator consists of three terms that all have a specific physical
interpretation:

\begin{labeling}{Concurrency:}
\item[Concurrency:] The first term models linear scalability that would
  exist if the different parts of the system (processors, threads \dots)
  could work without any interference caused by their interaction.
\item[Contention:] The second term of the denominator refers to the contention
  between different parts of the system. Most common are issues caused by
  serialization or queueing effects.
\item[Coherency:] The last term represents the delay induced by keeping the
  system in a coherent and consistent state. This is necessary when writable
  data is shared in different parts of the system. Predominant factors for
  such a delay are caches implemented in software and hardware.
\end{labeling}

In other words: $\sigma$ and $\kappa$ represent two concrete physical issues
that limit the achievable speedup for parallel execution. Note that the
contention and coherency terms grow linearly respectively quadratically with
$N$. As a consequence their influence becomes larger with an increasing $N$.

Due to the quadratic characteristic of the coherency term there will be a
point where the throughput of the system will start to go retrograde, i.e.,
will start to decrease with further increasing load.

In \cite{Gun07} Dr.~Gunther proves that \autoref{eqn:usl} is reduced to
Amdahl's Law for $\kappa = 0$. Therefore the Universal Scalability Law can be
seen as a generalization of Amdahl's Law for speedup in parallel computing.

We could solve this nonlinear equation to estimate the coefficients $\sigma$
and $\kappa$ using a sparse set of measurements for the throughput $X_i$ at
different loads $N_i$. The computations used to solve the equation for the
measured values are discussed in \cite{Gun07}.

The `\usl' package has been created to subsume the computation into one simple
function call. This greatly reduces the manual work that previously was needed
to perform the scalability analysis.

The function provided by the package also includes some sanity checks to help
the analyst with the data quality of the measurements.

Note that in \cite{Gun07} the coefficients are called $\sigma$ and $\kappa$
when hardware scalability is evaluated but $\alpha$ and $\beta$ when software
scalability is analyzed. The `\usl' package only uses \texttt{sigma} and
\texttt{kappa} as names of the coefficients.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Examples of Scalability Analysis}

The following sections present some examples of how the `\usl' package can
be used when performing a scalability analysis. They also explain typical
function calls and their arguments.

\subsection{Case Study: Hardware Scalability}

The `\usl' package contains a demo dataset with benchmark measurements from a
raytracer software\footnote{\url{http://sourceforge.net/projects/brlcad/}}.
The data was gathered on an SGI~Origin~2000 with 64 R12000 processors running
at 300~MHz.

A number of reference images with different levels of complexity were computed
for the benchmark. The measurements contain the average number of calculated
ray-geometry intersections per second for the number of used processors.

It is important to note that with changing hardware configurations the relative
number of \emph{homogeneous} application processes per processor is to be held
constant. So when $k$ application processes were used for the $N$ processor
benchmark then $2k$ processes must be used to get the result for $2N$
processors.

Start the analysis by loading the `\usl' package and look at the supplied
dataset.

<<>>=
library(usl)
data(raytracer)
raytracer
@

The data shows the throughput for different hardware configurations covering
the available range from one to 64 processors. We can easily see that the
benefit for switching from one processor to four processors is much larger than
the gain for upgrading from 48 to 64 processors.

Create a simple scatterplot to get a grip on the data.

<<rtplot1>>=
plot(throughput ~ processors, data = raytracer)
@

\autoref{fig:rtplot1} shows the throughput of the system for the different
number of processors. This plot is a typical example for the effects of
\emph{diminishing returns}\label{dimret}, because it clearly shows how the
benefit of adding more processors to the system gets smaller for higher
numbers of processors.

\begin{figure}[hbt]
\centering
<<fig=TRUE, echo=FALSE>>=
<<rtplot1>>
@
\caption{Measured throughput of a raytracing software in relation to the number of available processors}
\label{fig:rtplot1}
\end{figure}

Our next step builds the USL model from the dataset. The \kbd{usl()}
function creates an S4 object that encapsulates the computation.

The first argument is a formula with a symbolic description of the model we
want to analyze. In this case we would like to analyze how the ``throughput''
changes with regard to the number of ``processors'' in the system. The second
argument is the dataset with the measured values.

<<>>=
usl.model <- usl(throughput ~ processors, data = raytracer)
@

The model object can be investigated with the \kbd{summary()} function.

<<>>=
summary(usl.model)
@

The output of the \kbd{summary()} function shows different types of
information.

\begin{itemize}
\item First of all it includes the call we used to create the model.
\item It also includes the scale factor used for normalization. The scale
  factor is used internally to adjust the measured values to a common scale.
  It is equal to the value $X(1)$ of the measurements.
\item The efficiency tells us something about the ratio of useful work that is
  performed per processor. It is obvious that two processors might be able to
  handle twice the work of one processor but not more. Calculating the ratio of
  the workload per processor should therefore always be less or equal to $1$.
  In order to verify this, we can use the distribution of the efficiency values
  shown in the summary.
\item We are performing a regression on the data to calculate the coefficients
  and therefore we determine the residuals for the fitted values. The
  distribution of the residuals is also given as part of the summary.
\item The coefficients $\sigma$ and $\kappa$ are the result that we are
  essentially interested in. They tell us the magnitude of the contention and
  coherency effects within the system.
\item Finally $R^2$ estimates how well the model fits the data. We can see
  that the model is able to explain more than
  \Sexpr{floor(100*summary(usl.model)$r.squared)} percent of the data.
\end{itemize}

The function \kbd{efficiency()} extracts the efficiency values from the
model and allows us to have a closer look at the specific efficiencies of the
different processor configurations.

<<>>=
efficiency(usl.model)
@

A bar plot is useful to visually compare the decreasing efficiencies for the
configurations with an increasing number of processors. \autoref{fig:rtbarplot}
shows the output diagram.

<<rtbarplot>>=
barplot(efficiency(usl.model), ylab = "efficiency / processor", xlab = "processors")
@

\begin{figure}[hbt]
\centering
<<fig=TRUE, echo=FALSE>>=
<<rtbarplot>>
@
\caption{Rate of efficiency per processor for different numbers of processors running the raytracing software}
\label{fig:rtbarplot}
\end{figure}

The efficiency can be used for a first validation and sanity check of the
measured values. Values larger than $1.0$ usually need a closer investigation.
It is also suspicious if the efficiency gets bigger when the load increases.

The model coefficients $\sigma$ and $\kappa$ can be retrieved with the
\kbd{coef()} function.

<<>>=
coef(usl.model)
@

The corresponding confidence intervals for the model coefficients are returned
by calling the \kbd{confint()} function.

<<>>=
confint(usl.model, level = 0.95)
@

Earlier releases of the `\usl' package used bootstrapping to estmate the
confidence intervals. This has been changed since bootstrapping with a small
sample size may not give the desired accuracy. Currently the confidence
intervals are calculated from the standard errors of the parameters.

To get an impression of the scalability function we can use the \kbd{plot()}
function and create a combined graph with the original data as dots and the
calculated scalability function as a solid line. \autoref{fig:rtplot2} has the
result of that plot.

<<rtplot2>>=
plot(throughput ~ processors, data = raytracer, pch = 16)
plot(usl.model, add = TRUE)
@

\begin{figure}[hbt]
\centering
<<fig=TRUE, echo=FALSE>>=
<<rtplot2>>
@
\caption{Throughput of a raytracing software using different numbers of processors}
\label{fig:rtplot2}
\end{figure}

SGI marketed the Origin 2000 with up to 128 processors. Let's assume that
going from 64 to 128 processors does not introduce any additional limitations
to the system architecture. Then we can use the existing model and forecast
the system throughput for other numbers like 96 and 128 processors using the
\kbd{predict()} function.

<<>>=
predict(usl.model, data.frame(processors = c(96, 128)))
@

We can see from the prediction that there is still an increase in throughput
achievable with that number of processors. So we use the
\kbd{peak.scalability()} function now to determine the point where the
maximum throughput is reached.

<<>>=
peak.scalability(usl.model)
@

According to the model, the system would achieve its highest throughput with
\Sexpr{floor(peak.scalability(usl.model))} processors. This is certainly a
result that could not easily be deduced from the original dataset.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Case Study: Software Scalability}

In this section we will perform an analysis of a SPEC benchmark. A Sun
SPARCcenter 2000 with 16 CPUs was used in October 1994 for the SDM91
benchmark\footnote{\url{http://www.spec.org/osg/sdm91/results/results.html}}.
The benchmark simulates a number of users working on a UNIX server (editing
files, compiling \dots) and measures the number of script executions per hour.

First, select the demo dataset with the data from the SPEC SDM91 benchmark.

<<>>=
library(usl)
data(specsdm91)
specsdm91
@

The data provides the measurements made during the benchmark. The column
``load'' shows the number of virtual users that were simulated by the
benchmark and the column ``throughput'' has the measured number of script
executions per hour for that load.

Next we create the USL model for this dataset by calling the \kbd{usl()}
function. Again we specify a symbolic description of the model and the
dataset with the measurements. But this time we choose a different method for
the analysis.

<<>>=
usl.model <- usl(throughput ~ load, specsdm91, method = "nlxb")
@

There are currently three possible values for the \texttt{method} parameter:

\begin{labeling}{\texttt{default}:}
\item[\texttt{default}:] The default method uses a transformation into a 2nd
  degree polynomial. It can only be used if the data set contains a value for
  the normalization where the ``throughput'' equals $1$ for one measurement.
  This is the original procedure introduced in chapter 5.2.3 of \cite{Gun07}.
\item[\texttt{nls}:] This method uses the \kbd{nls()} function of the
  stats package for a nonlinear regression model. It estimates not only
  the coefficients $\sigma$ and $\kappa$ but also the scale factor for the
  normalization. The nonlinear regression uses constraints for its parameters
  which means the ``port'' algorithm is used internally to solve the model.
  So all restrictions of the ``port'' algorithm apply.
\item[\texttt{nlxb}:] A nonlinear regression model is also used in this case.
  But instead of the \kbd{nls()} function it uses the \kbd{nlxb()} function
  from the nlmrt package (see \cite{R:nlmrt}). This method also estimates both
  coefficients and the normalization factor. It is expected to be more robust
  than the \texttt{nls} method.
\end{labeling}

Keep in mind that if there is no measurement where ``load'' equals $1$ then the
default method does not work and an error message will be printed. In this case
one of the remaining methods must be used.

We also use the \kbd{summary()} function to look at the details for the
analysis.

<<>>=
summary(usl.model)
@

Looking at the coefficients we notice that $\sigma$ is about
\Sexpr{signif(coef(usl.model)[['sigma']], 2)} and $\kappa$ is about
\Sexpr{signif(coef(usl.model)[['kappa']], 1)}. The parameter $\sigma$ indicates
that about \Sexpr{signif(100*coef(usl.model)[['sigma']], 2)} percent of the
execution time is strictly serial. Note that this serial fraction is also
recognized in Amdahl's Law.

We hypothesize that a proposed change to the system --- maybe a redesign of
the cache architecture or the elimination of a point to point communication ---
could reduce $\kappa$ by half and want to predict how the scalability of the
system would change.

We can calculate the point of maximum scalability for the current system and
for the hypothetical system with the \kbd{peak.scalability()} function.

<<>>=
peak.scalability(usl.model)
peak.scalability(usl.model, kappa = 0.00005)
@

The function accepts the optional arguments \texttt{sigma} and \texttt{kappa}.
They are useful to do a what-if analysis. Setting these parameters override
the calculated model parameters and show how the system would behave with a
different contention or coherency coefficient.

In this case we learn that the point of peak scalability would move from
around \Sexpr{signif(peak.scalability(usl.model), 3)} to about
\Sexpr{signif(peak.scalability(usl.model, kappa=0.00005), 3)} if we would
be able to actually build the system with the assumed optimization.

Both calculated scalability functions can be plotted using the \kbd{plot()}
or \kbd{curve()} functions. The following commands create a graph of the
original data points and the derived scalability functions. To completely
include the scalability of the hypothetical system, we have to increase the
range of the plotted values with the first command.

<<spplot1>>=
plot(specsdm91, pch = 16, ylim = c(0,2500))
plot(usl.model, add = TRUE)
cache.scale <- scalability(usl.model, kappa = 0.00005)
curve(cache.scale, lty = 2, add = TRUE)
@

We used the function \kbd{scalability()} here. This function is a higher
order function returning a function and not just a single value. That makes
it possible to use the \kbd{curve()} function to plot the values over the
specific range.

\autoref{fig:spplot1} shows the measured throughput in scripts per hour for a
given load, i.e., the number of simulated users. The solid line indicates the
derived USL model while the dashed line resembles our hypothetical system using
the proposed optimization.

\begin{figure}[hbt]
\centering
<<fig=TRUE, echo=FALSE>>=
<<spplot1>>
@
\caption{The result of the SPEC SDM91 benchmark for a SPARCcenter 2000 (dots) together with the calculated scalability function (solid line) and a hypothetical scalability function (dashed line)}
\label{fig:spplot1}
\end{figure}

From the figure we can see that the scalability really peaks at one point.
Increasing the load beyond that point leads to retrograde behavior, i.e.,
the throughput decreases again. As we have calculated earlier, the measured
system will reach this point sooner than the hypothetical system.

We can combine the \kbd{scalability()} and the \kbd{peak.scalability()}
functions to get the predicted throughput values for the peak values.

<<>>=
scalability(usl.model)(peak.scalability(usl.model))
scf <- scalability(usl.model, kappa = 0.00005)
scf(peak.scalability(usl.model, kappa = 0.00005))
@

This illustrates how the Universal Scalability Law can help to decide if the
system currently is more limited by contention or by coherency issues and
also what impact a proposed change would have.

The \kbd{predict()} function can also be used to calculate a confidence bands
for the scalability function at a specified level. To get a smoother graph it
is advisable to predict the values for a higher number of points. Let's start
by creating a data frame with the required load values.

<<>>=
load <- with(specsdm91, expand.grid(load = seq(min(load), max(load))))
@

We use the data frame to determine the fitted values and also the upper and
lower confidence bounds at the requested level. The result will be a matrix
with column names \kbd{fit} for the fitted values, \kbd{lwr} for the lower
and \kbd{upr} for the upper bounds.

<<>>=
fit <- predict(usl.model, newdata = load, interval = "confidence", level = 0.95)
@

The matrix is used to define the coordinates of a polygon containing the area
between the lower and the upper bounds. The polygon connects the points of the
lower bounds from lower to higher values and then back using the points of the
upper bounds.

<<>>=
usl.polygon <- matrix(c(load[, 1], rev(load[, 1]),
                        fit[, 'lwr'], rev(fit[, 'upr'])),
                 nrow = 2 * nrow(load))
@

The plot is composed from multiple single plots. The first plot initializes the
canvas and creates the axis. Then the polygon is plotted using a gray area. In
the next step the measured values are added as points. Finally a solid line is
plotted to indicate the fitted scalability function.

<<ciplot1>>=
# Create empty plot (define canvas size, axis, ...)
plot(specsdm91,
     ylim = c(0, 2000), 
     xlab = names(specsdm91)[1],
     ylab = names(specsdm91)[2], 
     type = "n")

# Plot gray polygon indicating the confidence interval
polygon(usl.polygon, border = NA, col = "gray")

# Plot the measured throughput
points(specsdm91, pch = 16)

# Plot the fit
lines(load[, 1], fit[, 'fit'])
@

See \autoref{fig:ciplot1} for the entire plot.

\begin{figure}[hbt]
\centering
<<fig=TRUE, echo=FALSE>>=
<<ciplot1>>
@
\caption{The result of the SPEC SDM91 benchmark with confidence bands for the scalability function at the 95\% level}
\label{fig:ciplot1}
\end{figure}

Another way to illustrate the impact of the parameters $\sigma$ and $\kappa$ on
the scalability is by looking at the achievable speedup when a fixed load is
parallelized. A naive estimation would be that doubling the degree of 
parallelization should cut the execution time in halve.

Unfortunately it doesn't work this way. In general there is a range where
doubling the parallelization will actually improve the execution time. But the
improvement will get smaller and smaller when the degree of parallelism is
increased further. This is also an effect of \emph{diminishing returns} as
already seen in \autoref{dimret}. The real execution time is in fact the sum
of the ideal execution time and the overhead for dealing with contention and
coherency delays.

Dr.~Gunther shows in \cite{DBLP:journals/corr/abs-0808-1431} how the total
execution time of a parallelized workload depends on the degree of parallelism
$p$ and the coefficients $\sigma$ and $\kappa$ of the associated USL model.
Equation 26 in his paper identifies the magnitude of the three components
--- given as fractions of the serial execution time $T_1$ --- that account for
the total execution time of the parallelized workload.

\begin{align}
T_{ideal}      &= \frac{1}{p} T_1\label{eqn:ideal}\\
T_{contention} &= \sigma \left(\frac{p-1}{p}\right) T_1\label{eqn:contention}\\
T_{coherency}  &= \kappa \frac{1}{2} (p-1) T_1\label{eqn:coherency}
\end{align}

The function \kbd{overhead()} can be used to calculate the correspondent
fractions for a given model. The function has the same interface as the
\kbd{predict()} function. Calling it with only the model as argument will
calculate the overhead for the fitted values. It can also be called with a
data frame as second argument. Then the data frame will be used to determine
the values for the calculation.

Let's use our current model to calculate the overhead for a load of $10$,
$20$, $100$ and $200$ simulated users. We create a data frame with the number
of users and use the \kbd{overhead()} function to estimate the overhead.

<<>>=
load <- data.frame(load = c(10, 20, 100, 200))
ovhd <- overhead(usl.model, newdata = load)
ovhd
@

We can see that the ideal execution time for running $10$ jobs in parallel is
$\nicefrac{1}{10}$ of the execution time of running the jobs unparallelized.
To get the total fraction we have to add the overhead for contention
($\Sexpr{100*signif(ovhd[1,'contention'], 2)}\%$) and for coherency delays
($\Sexpr{100*signif(ovhd[1,'coherency'], 2)}\%$). 
This gives a total of $\Sexpr{100*signif(sum(ovhd[1,]), 4)}\%$. So with $10$
jobs in parallel we are only about $\Sexpr{signif(1/sum(ovhd[1,]), 2)}$ times
faster than running the same workload in a serial way.

\autoref{eqn:contention} shows that the percentage of time spent on dealing
with contention will converge to the value of $\sigma$. \autoref{eqn:coherency}
explains that coherency delays will grow beyond any limit if the degree of
parallelism is large enough. This corresponds to the observation that adding
more parallelism will sometimes make performance worse.

A stacked barplot can be used to visualize how the different effects change
with an increasing degree of parallelism. Note that the result matrix must be
transposed to match the format needed for for the \kbd{barplot()} command.

<<ovplot1>>=
barplot(height = t(ovhd), names.arg = load[, 1],
        xlab = names(load), legend.text = TRUE)
@

\begin{figure}[hbt]
\centering
<<fig=TRUE, echo=FALSE>>=
<<ovplot1>>
@
\caption{Components of the execution time for parallelized workloads of the SPECSDM91 benchmark. The time is measured as a fraction of the time needed for serial execution of the workload.}
\label{fig:ovplot1}
\end{figure}

\autoref{fig:ovplot1} shows the resulting plot. It clearly shows the decrease
in ideal execution time when the degree of parallelism is increased. It also
shows how initially almost only contention contributes to the total execution
time. For higher degrees of parallelism the impact of coherency delays grows.
Note how the difference in ideal execution time between $100$ and $200$
parallel jobs effectively has no effect on the total execution time.
