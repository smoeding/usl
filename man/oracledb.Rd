\title{Performance of an Oracle database used for online transaction processing}
\format{
A data frame with 360 rows on 8 variables
}
\description{
A dataset containing performance data for an Oracle OLTP database measured
between 8:00am and 8:00pm on January, 19th 2012. The measurements were
recorded for two minute intervals during this time and a timestamp indicates
the end of the measurement interval. The performance metrics were taken from
the \code{v$sysmetric} family of system performance views.
}
\details{
The Oracle database was running on a 4-way server.

The data frame contains different types of measurements:
\itemize{
  \item Variables of the "time" type are expressed in seconds per second.
  \item Variables of the "rate" type are expressed in events per second.
  \item Variables of the "util" type are expressed as a percentage.
}

The data frame contains the following variables:
\itemize{
  \item \code{timestamp} The end of the two minute interval for which the
    remaining variables contain the measurements.
  \item \code{db_time} The time spent inside the database either working on
    a CPU or waiting  (I/O, locks, buffer waits ...). This time is expressed
    as seconds per second, so two sessions working for exactly one second
    each will contribute a total of two seconds per second of \code{db_time}.
    In Oracle this value is also known as \emph{Average Active Sessions}
    (AAS).
  \item \code{cpu_time} The CPU time used during the interval. This is also
    expressed as seconds per second. A 4-way machine has a theoretical
    capacity of four CPU seconds per second.
  \item \code{call_rate} The number of user calls (logins, parses, or
    execute calls) per second.
  \item \code{exec_rate} The number of statement executions per second.
  \item \code{lio_rate} The number of logical I/Os per second. A logical
    I/O is the Oracle term for a cache hit in the database buffer cache.
    This metric does not indicate if an additional physical I/O was
    necessary to load the buffer from disk.
  \item \code{txn_rate} The number of database transactions per second.
  \item \code{cpu_util} The CPU utilization of the database server in
    percent. This was also measured from within the database.
