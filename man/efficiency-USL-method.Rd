\title{Efficiency of the system}
\usage{
\S4method{efficiency}{USL}(object)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{A USL object.}
}
\value{
A vector of numeric values.
}
\description{
The efficiency of a system expressed in terms of the deviation from
linear scalability.
}
\details{
The function returns a vector which contains the deviation from linearity
for every measurement of the model input.  A value of \code{1} indicates
linear scalability while values less than \code{1} correspond to the
fraction of the measurement compared to linear scalability.
