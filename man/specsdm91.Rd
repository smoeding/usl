}
\details{
A Sun SPARCcenter 2000 with 16 CPUs was used for the SPEC SDM91 benchmark
in October 1994. The benchmark simulates a number of users working on the
UNIX server and measures the number of script executions per hour.

The data frame contains the following variables:
\itemize{
  \item \code{load} The number of simulated users (1--216).
  \item \code{throughput} The achieved throughput in scripts per hour.
