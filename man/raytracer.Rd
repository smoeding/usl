\description{
A dataset containing performance data for a ray-tracing benchmark.
}
\details{
The benchmark measured the number of ray-geometry intersections per second.
The data was gathered on an SGI Origin 2000 with 64 R12000 processors
running at 300 MHz.

The data frame contains the following variables:
\itemize{
  \item \code{processors} The number of CPUs used for the benchmark (1--64).
  \item \code{throughput} The number of operations per second.
}
