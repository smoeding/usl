\title{Analyze system scalability with the Universal Scalability Law}
\description{
The Universal Scalability Law is a model to predict hardware and software
scalability. It uses system capacity as a function of load to forecast the
scalability for the system.
}
\details{
Use the function \code{\link{usl}} to create a model from a formula and
a data frame.

The USL model produces two coefficients as result: \code{alpha} models the
contention and \code{beta} the coherency delay of the system.

The Universal Scalability Law has been created by Dr. Neil J. Gunther.
