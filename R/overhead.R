#' Overhead method for Universal Scalability Law models
#'
#' \code{overhead} calculates the overhead in processing time for a system
#' modeled with the Universal Scalability Law.
#' It evaluates the regression function in the frame \code{newdata} (which
#' defaults to \code{model.frame(object)}). The result contains the ideal
#' processing time and the additional overhead caused by contention and
#' coherency delays.
#'
#' The calculated processing times are given as percentages of a
#' non-parallelized workload. So for a non-parallelized workload the ideal
#' processing time will always be given as \emph{100\%} while the overhead
#' for contention and coherency will always be zero.
#'
#' Doubling the capacity will cut the ideal processing time in half but
#' increase the overhead percentages. The increase of the overhead depends on
#' the values of the parameters \code{alpha} and \code{beta} estimated by
#' \code{\link{usl}}.
#'
#' The calculation is based on \emph{A General Theory of Computational
#' Scalability Based on Rational Functions}, equation 26.
#'
#' @param object A USL model object for which the overhead will be calculated.
#' @param newdata An optional data frame in which to look for variables
#'   with which to calculate the overhead.
#'   If omitted, the fitted values are used.
#'
#' @return \code{overhead} produces a matrix of overhead percentages based on
#'   a non-parallelized workload. The column \code{ideal} contains the ideal
#'   percentage of execution time. The columns \code{contention} and
#'   \code{coherency} give the additional overhead percentage caused by
#'   the respective effects.
