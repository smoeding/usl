#' Analyze system scalability with the Universal Scalability Law
#'
#' The Universal Scalability Law is a model to predict hardware and software
#' scalability. It uses system capacity as a function of load to forecast the
#' scalability for the system.
#'
#' Use the function \code{\link{usl}} to create a model from a formula and
#' a data frame.
#'
#' The USL model produces two coefficients as result: \code{alpha} models the
#' contention and \code{beta} the coherency delay of the system.
#'
#' The Universal Scalability Law has been created by Dr. Neil J. Gunther.
