#' Extract parts of a "\code{USL}" object
#'
#' The operator extracts a part of a \code{\link{USL-class}} object.
#'
#' This is a generic method for the class used in the usl package.
#'
#' The operator is used internally by functions like \code{\link{coef}}, so
#' it is necessary to have a working implementation of the \code{coef}
#' function.
#'
#' @param x Object from which to extract elements.
#' @param name A literal character string or a \link{name} (possibly quoted).
#'
#' @seealso \code{\link{USL-class}}, \code{\link{Extract}}

#' usl.model$coefficients
#' }
