#' Class "\code{USL}" for Universal Scalability Law models
#'
#' This class encapsulates the Universal Scalability Law. Use the function
#' \code{\link{usl}} to create new objects from this class.
#'
#' @slot frame The model frame.
#' @slot call The call used to create the model.
#' @slot regr The name of the regressor variable.
#' @slot resp The name of the response variable.
#' @slot coefficients The coefficients alpha, beta and gamma of the model.
#' @slot coef.std.err The standard errors for the coefficients alpha and beta.
#' @slot coef.names A vector with the names of the coefficients.
#' @slot fitted The fitted values of the model. This is a vector.
#' @slot residuals The residuals of the model. This is a vector.
#' @slot df.residual The degrees of freedom of the model.
#' @slot sigma The residual standard deviation of the model.
#' @slot limit The scalability limit as per Amdahl.
#' @slot peak A vector with the predictor and response values of the peak.
#' @slot optimal A vector with the optimal predictor and response values.
#' @slot efficiency The efficiency, e.g. speedup per processor.
#' @slot na.action The \code{na.action} used by the model.
