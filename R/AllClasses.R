#'
#' @slot frame The model frame.
#' @slot call The call used to create the model.
#' @slot regr The name of the regressor variable.
#' @slot resp The name of the response variable.
#' @slot scale.factor The scale factor used to create the model.
#' @slot coefficients The coefficients alpha and beta of the model.
#' @slot coef.std.err The standard errors for the coefficients alpha and beta.
#' @slot coef.names A vector with the names of the coefficients.
#' @slot fitted The fitted values of the model. This is a vector.
#' @slot residuals The residuals of the model. This is a vector.
#' @slot df.residual The degrees of freedom of the model.
#' @slot r.squared Coefficient of determination of the model.
#' @slot adj.r.squared Adjusted coefficient of determination.
